Here's the optimized prompt sequence for incremental implementation:

```markdown
# Prompt 1: Project Setup and Base Template
``text
Create a Next.js 14 TypeScript project with:
- Frame SDK v2 configured
- Base layout with viewport meta tags for mobile
- CSS reset with box-sizing: border-box
- Root layout with @/app/layout.tsx
- Home page with empty game container div
- Configure dynamic viewport units (dvh/dvw) in CSS
- Add landscape orientation media query
- Customize document title to "Flappy Helicopter"
- Initialize LocalStorage hooks for score tracking
```

# Prompt 2: Core Game Loop Setup
``text
Implement canvas-based game loop:
- Dynamic canvas creation/resizing with useRef
- requestAnimationFrame animation cycle
- Basic game state machine (START, PLAYING, GAME_OVER)
- Viewport-relative coordinate system
- Background scrolling effect
- Frame handler for state persistence
- Add use-game-loop custom hook
- Wire canvas to game container div
```

# Prompt 3: Helicopter Movement System
``text
Add helicopter controller:
- Physics params (gravity, thrust, max velocity)
- Touch/pointer event handlers (down/up)
- Sprite position calculation
- Velocity-based movement
- Rotation based on vertical speed
- Collision bounds detection
- Wire controls to game state
- Add visual debug hitbox
```

# Prompt 4: Obstacle Generation
``text
Implement procedural obstacles:
- Object pool pattern for pipes
- Generation algorithm with random gaps
- Scroll movement synchronized with background
- Recycling system for off-screen obstacles
- Collision detection integration
- Add obstacle rendering to game loop
- Wire to game state machine
```

# Prompt 5: Game UI Overlay
``text
Create HUD components:
- Distance counter overlay
- Tap-to-start modal
- Game over panel with:
  - Restart button
  - Share score button
  - Best score display
- Animated transitions
- LocalStorage integration
- Wire UI to game state
```

# Prompt 6: Frame Metadata Integration
``text
Implement social features:
- Dynamic meta tags for score sharing
- Signed message payload generation
- Deep link creation for challenges
- OpenGraph image generation
- Frame button handlers
- Post-game share payload
- Wire to UI components
```

# Prompt 7: Mobile Optimization
``text
Add mobile-specific enhancements:
- Touch action CSS properties
- 300ms click delay prevention
- Haptic feedback patterns
- Viewport orientation lock
- Edge-to-edge canvas
- Performance optimizations
- Input event normalization
- Wire to existing controls
```

# Prompt 8: Final Polish
``text
Add finishing touches:
- Particle effects on crash
- Score increment animation
- Sound effects manager stub
- Visual feedback for inputs
- Loading state transitions
- Error boundary handling
- Accessibility labels
- Full integration test
```
Each prompt builds on previous implementations while maintaining working state transitions. The sequence follows: Core infrastructure → Game mechanics → UI → Social → Polish. Mobile considerations are integrated at each layer with final optimizations.
