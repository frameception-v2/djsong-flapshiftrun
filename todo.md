Here's the optimized 20-task checklist following your requirements:

- [x] 1. Create Next.js 14 TS project with Frame SDK v2 (base setup)
- [x] 2. Add viewport meta tags and CSS reset in layout.tsx (mobile foundation)
- [x] 3. Implement useLocalStorage hooks for score persistence (state foundation)
- [x] 4. Create canvas context wrapper in home page (rendering foundation)
- [x] 5. Build game state machine with START/PLAYING/GAME_OVER (core logic)
- [x] 6. Implement useGameLoop hook with requestAnimationFrame (animation core)
- [x] 7. Add dynamic viewport units and background scroll (visual foundation)
- [x] 8. Configure helicopter physics parameters (gravity, thrust)
- [x] 9. Add touch/pointer event handlers to canvas (input system)
- [ ] 10. Implement velocity-based movement calculations (heli physics)
- [ ] 11. Create collision detection system with hitboxes (game logic)
- [ ] 12. Build obstacle object pool with gap randomization (challenge system)
- [ ] 13. Add synchronized obstacle scroll logic (game sync)
- [ ] 14. Implement obstacle recycling on exit viewport (performance)
- [ ] 15. Create HUD components with score display (UI foundation)
- [ ] 16. Build game over modal with restart/share buttons (UI flow)
- [ ] 17. Add dynamic meta tags for score sharing (Frame integration)
- [ ] 18. Implement OpenGraph image generation endpoint (social features)
- [ ] 19. Add touch action CSS and input normalization (mobile UX)
- [ ] 20. Create particle system and accessibility labels (final polish)

Tasks follow strict dependency order: 
1-4 (setup) → 5-7 (core) → 8-11 (heli) → 12-14 (obstacles) → 15-16 (UI) → 17-18 (social) → 19 (mobile) → 20 (polish). Each task completes one vertical slice while maintaining working state.
